# Yara
YARA is a multi-platform program running on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

This Documents will expect you to understand basic Linux familiarity, such as installing software and commands for general navigation of the system. Moreso, this room isn't designed to test your knowledge or for point-scoring. It is here to encourage you to follow along and experiment with what you have learned here.
Yara was developed by Victor M. Alvarez ([@plusvic](https://twitter.com/plusvic)) and [@VirusTotal](https://twitter.com/virustotal). Check the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/virustotal/yara).
